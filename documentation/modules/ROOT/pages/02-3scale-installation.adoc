[#prerequisite]
== Prerequisties
3scale requires a RWX storage for the developer portal. We will leverage the OpenShift Data Foundation for this. The OpenShift Data Foundation needs atleast 3 worker nodes (is they are not configured on your cluster already, please follow the below steps)

[#increase-machine-count]
== Increase Worker Node Count
. On your OpenShift Console UI, navigate to Administrator > Compute > Machine Sets and increase the machine count to 3 as shown below
+
image::machine-count.gif[]

. Give it a few seconds to confirm the node is up and running

[NOTE]
===============================
 Ideally all this stuff would be setup during the configuration of your OpenShift Cluster. 
 For the purpose of this demo we are just building things from ground up
===============================


[#install-openshift-data-foundation]
== ODF Installation
The whole lab is going to leverage Operators for installation of all the components. Users can configure the operators either via cli or console.

. On your OpenShift Console UI, navigate to Administrator > Operators > OperatorHub and search for OpenShift Data Foundation. Leave all the values as Default and click on install.

+
The operator installation might take a minute or two

. Wait for the operator to install and when you see the below screen, click on Create StorageSystem
+

. Make sure the gp2 StorageClass is selected and click Next
+

. Select all the three nodes and leave all the other values as default. Click Next
+

. Leave all the values as default. Click Next

. Click on Create StorageSystem

[#3scale Installation]
== 3scale Installation

. Create a 3scale namespace on your OpenShift Cluster.  Navigate to Administrator > Project > Create Project. Type 3scale as the name of the project and create.

. On your OpenShift Console UI, navigate to Administrator > Operators > OperatorHub and search for 3scale. Select the Red Hat Integration Operator - 3scale. Double check and make sure you are in the 3scale namespace while you do this
+
image::3scale-operator-search.png[]

. Click on Install
+
image::operator-install-screen-3scale.png[]

. Double check and make sure the 3scale namespace is selected. Leave all the options as default and click Install
+
image::operator-namespace-selection-3scale.png[]

. Once the installation is complete (will take a few seconds). Click on View Operator
+
image::3scale-view-operator.png[]

. Now let's create the API manager. Deploying the APIManager custom resource will make the operator begin processing and will deploy a 3scale solution from it. 

. Click on the API Manager tab > Create APIManager > YAML view >. Remove the the existing yaml and copy paste the code provided in step 3 as shown below

If the Cluster WildCard URL is not populated already in the above yaml, please enter it the respective text box above. You can find the *cluster wildcard url* dns of your OpenShift cluster from the Console URL. Make a note of the *cluster wildcard url* as it'll be useful later
